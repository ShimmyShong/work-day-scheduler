# Workday Scheduler

## Description
This is a 9-5 workday scheduler! It will tell you the date and give you information about whether something you scheduled should've happened yet or not. You'll be able to write a message to each hour, then if you click on the save icon, it'll be saved even if you leave and come back later. While I was making this website, I learned a lot about DOM traversing with JQuery and the importance of parsing data types.
